# 🏰 New World - AFK Away
This application was developed as an auto-clicked to ensure I was not removed from server for times of inactivity. Around the launch of the Amazon title *New World*, it was almost impossible to get into servers and if you were able, you couldn't leave without hours of queue times. This application allowed me to remain in the lobby without being removed for being inactive.

**🚨 Please Note: New World does check for auto-clickers now so use at your own risk. The server times are normal now so the use of this application isn't truly needed any longer.**

# 📋 Features
* Choose a custom time interval for the pattern to be invoked.
* Choose from a number of patterns so that the auto-click checker does not pick up on the same keystrokes.
* Repeat until stopped or `x` number of times.
* Editable hotkey that remains persistent between application launches.
